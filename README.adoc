debootstrap-helper
==================
v2020.30

This project provides a customized wrapper around Debian's
standard "debootstrap" script which invokes it with the right
options for complete offline operation using a two-phase approach
based on the --foreign option of debootstrap.

It also gives advice for common problems, such as missing signing
keys.

The script should also work for most Debian-derived Linux
distribution with only small modifications.
